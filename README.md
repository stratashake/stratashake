## Bioinformatics Enthusiast | Data Analysis Intermediate | Lifelong Learner

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm a newly graduated bioinformatician (MSc) with a wet lab background. I'm passionate about structural bioinformatics, RNA-seq analysis, data science, and genomics. My journey in bioinformatics is driven by a fascination with the complexities of genetic data and a commitment to contribute to meaningful scientific discoveries.

### üóÇÔ∏è **For Recruiters and Non-Coders: Navigating My Repositories**
If you're not familiar with coding or GitHub, here's a quick guide to help you navigate my repositories:
- **Repository Overview**: Each repository (repo) is a separate project or collection of files. You can view a list of all my repos on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/stratashake).
- **ReadMe Files**: Most repos have a 'README.md' file. This file provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and how to use or understand the content.

### üéì **Educational Background:**
- **Master of Science in Bioinformatics** from Brandeis University
- **Bachelor of Science in Biology** from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Magna Cum Laude

### üíº **Professional Experience:**
- **Clinical Lab Technician** at Alimetrix and Kailos Genetics: Specialized in DNA/RNA extraction, amplification, and quantification, working with diverse samples including COVID-19, STIs, UTIs, and cheek swabs. I also have extensive work in R&D projects that require quick adaptation and daily adjustments.  
- **Research Volunteer** in Microbiology, Psychology, and Genetics labs at UAH.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Skills:**
- **Programming**: Proficient in Python and R, with a focus on data analysis, machine learning, and pipeline development.
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: Experienced with tools like AlphaFold, BEDTools, PyMOL, and more.
- **NGS Data Analysis**: Skilled in using platforms like Cytoscape, GSEA, and WGCNA for genomic and transcriptomic analysis.

### üåü **Projects and Interests:**
- **Structural Bioinformatics/Drug Development**: Conducted structural analysis of proteins for antibiotic development using tools like PyMOL and Vina Docking.
- **RNA-seq & Microarray Transcriptomic Analysis**: Developed pipelines in R for differential gene expression analysis, leveraging machine learning techniques.
- **Biological Sequence Analysis**: Actively solving bioinformatics problems on rosalind.info to enhance my Python skills and stay current with bioinformatics algorithms.
- **CASTp Plugin Update for Python 3**: Rewrote the code for a PyMOL plugin (CASTp, used for protein domain analysis) so it could be used in Python 3 environments. 

### üìö **Independent Learning:**
- Continuously exploring new tools and methodologies in bioinformatics to improve my skill set such as learning SQL or exploring nf-core pipelines.
